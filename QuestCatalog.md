# Quest System Spec

> NOTE: The sections **Expanded Daily Quest Pool** and **Expanded Weekly Quest Pool**
> are the current source of truth for quest IDs and definitions.
> Code should match those tables. Do NOT edit this file via Codex.

This document defines the XP economy, quest catalog, and generation rules for QuestChat.

- Copy rules:
  - Any quest with a numeric requirement (minutes, sessions, days, cups, HP%) **must** state the exact requirement in its subtitle.
  - Avoid jargon like “sprint” – use “session”, “timer”, “day”, etc.

---

## XP Economy

- XP per level: **100 XP**
- Level formula: `level = floor(totalXP / 100)`

### Quest Difficulty Tiers

| Difficulty | Code    | XP Reward |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Tiny      | TIER_1  | 10 XP     |
| Small     | TIER_2  | 20 XP     |
| Medium    | TIER_3  | 35 XP     |
| Big       | TIER_4  | 60 XP     |

All quest XP values below use these tiers.

---

## Quest Types and Categories

**Types**
- `daily_core` – core loop quests that most users should see
- `daily_habit` – user-selected habits (hydration, focus, chores, HP, etc.)
- `bonus` – optional extra quests with higher XP or extra conditions
- `weekly` – longer arcs spanning the week
- `streak` – “X days in a row” bonuses (no punishment if broken)

**Categories**
- `focus` – focus timers, deep work, productivity
- `hydration` – water intake
- `hp_core` – mood, gut, sleep, HP bar
- `chores_work` – chores, cleaning, errands, work sessions
- `meta` – app usage: quests tab, stats tab, planning, reviews

**Completion Events (conceptual)**
These refer to events or derived stats the app already has or can easily expose:

- `focus_session_started(durationMinutes)`
- `focus_session_completed(durationMinutes)`
- `quick_timer_completed(category, durationMinutes)`
- `hydration_total_today_oz`
- `hydration_log_events_today`
- `hp_checkin_completed` (mood + gut + sleep set)
- `hp_value_now`
- `hp_value_start_of_day`
- `quests_tab_opened_today`
- `stats_tab_opened_after(timeOfDay)`
- `current_time_of_day`
- `day_end_snapshot` (HP, hydration, etc.)

Implementation details can be adjusted, but each quest has a clear condition.

## Daily Core Quests (10)

## Quest Generation Rules

### Daily Quest Generation

When a new day starts (or on first app open after midnight):

1. **Reset daily quests**
   - Mark all previous daily quests as archived.
   - Generate a new set for the current day.

2. **Core anchors (always included)**
   - Always include these three `daily_core` quests:
     - `LOAD_QUEST_LOG`
     - `PLAN_FOCUS_SESSION`
     - `HEALTHBAR_CHECKIN`

3. **Additional core quests**
   - Randomly select **2 more** quests from the remaining `daily_core` pool:
     - `COMPLETE_FOCUS_SESSION`
     - `HYDRATE_CHECKPOINT_16OZ`
     - `HYDRATE_CHECKPOINT_48OZ`
     - `IRL_PATCH_UPDATE`
     - `CHORE_BLITZ`
     - `STATS_REVIEW`
     - `WINDDOWN_ROUTINE`
   - Avoid picking two hydration quests at once if Hydration habits are off.

4. **Habit quests**
   - For each habit category the user has enabled (hydration/focus/hp_core/chores_work), pick **1 random `daily_habit` quest** from that category.
   - Max of **4 habit quests** per day.
   - If user has fewer habit categories enabled, you may pick a second quest from a high-priority habit (e.g., focus or hydration).

5. **Bonus quest**
   - Optionally add **1 `bonus` quest** (can reuse a `daily_habit` or `daily_core` definition but flagged as bonus) based on what was low yesterday:
     - If focus minutes were low → prefer a focus quest.
     - If hydration was low → prefer a hydration quest.
     - If HP was low → prefer an HP quest.

6. **Quest chest requirement**
   - Every day, exactly **4 quests** are flagged `counts_for_daily_chest = true`:
     - `LOAD_QUEST_LOG`
     - `PLAN_FOCUS_SESSION`
     - `HEALTHBAR_CHECKIN`
     - 1 additional quest (either a habit quest or a core quest chosen by the generator).
   - When all `counts_for_daily_chest` quests are completed, the user can claim the Quest Chest.
   - **Chest reward:** 75 XP (flat).

7. **Total daily XP target (from quests)**
   - With the above mix, a “normal” day should offer:
     - 3 core anchors ≈ 80 XP
     - 2 extra core quests ≈ 40–95 XP
     - 2–4 habit quests ≈ 70–160 XP
     - Chest reward: 75 XP  
     -> Rough range ≈ **190–310 XP** from quests alone, plus XP from timers if you award that separately.

### Weekly Quest Generation

When a new week starts (or first app open on the start-of-week day):

1. **Reset weekly quests**
   - Archive last week’s weekly quests and snapshot their state.

2. **Generate weekly quests**
   - Always include these four:
     - `WEEK_FOCUS_10_SESSIONS`
     - `WEEK_HYDRATE_4_DAYS_64OZ`
     - `WEEK_HP_5_CHECKINS`
     - `WEEK_DAILY_CORE_4_DAYS`
   - Then pick **2 additional** from:
     - `WEEK_FOCUS_3_DEEP`
     - `WEEK_CHORE_5_TIMERS`
     - `WEEK_SELFCARE_3_DAYS`
     - `WEEK_MOVEMENT_3_DAYS`
   - Total weekly quests visible: **6** at a time.

3. **Weekly progress**
   - Progress updates passively as normal events occur (no special actions needed).
   - Weekly quests never block daily quests; they are always optional extra XP.

### Reroll Rules

- User may **reroll 1 daily quest per day**.
- Only **incomplete** quests can be rerolled.
- Reroll picks a replacement quest that:
  - Matches the **same type** (`daily_core` vs `daily_habit` vs `bonus`).
  - Matches the **same difficulty tier** (Tiny/Small/Medium/Big).
  - Preferably matches the **same category** (hydration/focus/etc.) to avoid punishment.
- If the rerolled quest was `counts_for_daily_chest = true`, the replacement quest also gets `counts_for_daily_chest = true`.

Keep the original daily quests above. The following additions give the board more variety across timer, HealthBar, meta, and easy-win quests. Each quest is designed to be completable once per day unless noted otherwise.

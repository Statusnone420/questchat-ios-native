# Quest System Spec

> NOTE: The sections **Daily Quests – Five-Slot Model**, **Expanded Daily Quest Pool**,
> and **Expanded Weekly Quest Pool** are the current source of truth for quest IDs and
> definitions. Code should match those tables. Do NOT edit this file via Codex.

This document defines the XP economy, quest catalog, and generation rules for QuestChat.

- Copy rules:
  - Any quest with a numeric requirement (minutes, sessions, days, cups, HP%) **must** state the exact requirement in its subtitle.
  - Avoid jargon like “sprint” – use “session”, “timer”, “day”, etc.

---

## XP Economy

- XP per level: **100 XP**
- Level formula: `level = floor(totalXP / 100)`

### Quest Difficulty Tiers

| Difficulty | Code    | XP Reward |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Tiny      | TIER_1  | 10 XP     |
| Small     | TIER_2  | 20 XP     |
| Medium    | TIER_3  | 35 XP     |
| Big       | TIER_4  | 60 XP     |

All quest XP values below use these tiers.

## Quest Types and Categories

**Types**
- `daily_core` – core loop quests that most users should see
- `daily_habit` – user-selected habits (hydration, focus, chores, HP, etc.)
- `bonus` – optional extra quests with higher XP or extra conditions
- `weekly` – longer arcs spanning the week
- `streak` – “X days in a row” bonuses (no punishment if broken)

**Categories**
- `focus` – focus timers, deep work, productivity
- `hydration` – water intake
- `hp_core` – mood, gut, sleep, HP bar
- `chores_work` – chores, cleaning, errands, work sessions
- `meta` – app usage: quests tab, stats tab, planning, reviews

**Completion Events (conceptual)**
These refer to events or derived stats the app already has or can easily expose:

- `focus_session_started(durationMinutes)`
- `focus_session_completed(durationMinutes)`
- `quick_timer_completed(category, durationMinutes)`
- `hydration_total_today_oz`
- `hydration_log_events_today`
- `hp_checkin_completed` (mood + gut + sleep set)
- `hp_value_now`
- `hp_value_start_of_day`
- `quests_tab_opened_today`
- `stats_tab_opened_after(timeOfDay)`
- `current_time_of_day`
- `day_end_snapshot` (HP, hydration, etc.)

Implementation details can be adjusted, but each quest has a clear condition.

## Daily Quests – Five-Slot Model

Daily quests follow a five-slot model so they feel like meaningful moves instead of paperwork. Each slot has a job:

1. **Show up** – open quests (`LOAD_QUEST_LOG`).
2. **Aim the day** – set focus (`CHOOSE_MAIN_QUEST`).
3. **Check your HP** – health check-in (`HEALTHBAR_CHECKIN`).
4. **Push something forward** – focus / chores / work quest (pick one from the focus pool).
5. **Protect the human** – recovery / hydration / environment quest (pick one from the recovery pool).

If a daily doesn’t do one of those jobs, it either moves to a weekly arc or becomes background XP (e.g., raw hydration logging or posture taps).

### Anchors (always included)

| ID                         | Type        | Category   | Difficulty | XP  | Title                     | Subtitle                                  | Completion Condition (concept)                               |
|----------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| LOAD_QUEST_LOG             | daily_core  | meta       | Tiny      | 10  | Load today’s quest log    | Open the Quests tab at least once today.  | First time the Quests tab is opened on a given day.          |
| CHOOSE_MAIN_QUEST          | daily_core  | meta       | Small     | 20  | Choose today’s main quest | Pick today’s focus: Work / Self-Care / Chill / Grind. | Player card focus set for the day.                           |
| HEALTHBAR_CHECKIN          | daily_core  | hp_core    | Small     | 20  | HealthBar check-in        | Log mood and last night’s sleep.          | Mood and sleep both logged today.                            |


These three keep the “log in, aim, check HP” loop intact every day.

### Focus / Work Pool (slot 4 – push something forward)

Pick exactly one from this pool per day.

| ID                         | Type        | Category    | Difficulty | XP  | Title                     | Subtitle                                         | Completion Condition (concept)                               |

|----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|

### Light “Feel Good” Dailies (optional swaps for slots 4 or 5)

Occasionally replace the focus or protection slot with one of these for a lighter day.

| ID                         | Type        | Category   | Difficulty | XP  | Title                     | Subtitle                                  | Completion Condition (concept)                 |
|----------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| MICRO_QUEST_CHAIN          | daily_core  | meta       | Small     | 20  | Micro-Quest Chain         | Complete any two quests today.            | Total quest completions today ≥ 2.            |

Retired daily chores for this model:
- Single-action hydration or posture taps (e.g., “log 4 oz”, “tap posture once”).
- Duplicates with slightly different thresholds (e.g., half-goal vs full-goal hydration).
These shift into weekly arcs or background XP instead of cluttering the daily list.

## Daily Habit Quests (16)

These are `weekly` type quests that sit in a separate “Weekly quests” section with longer-term goals.

## Quest Generation Rules

### Daily Quest Generation

When a new day starts (or on first app open after midnight):

1. **Reset daily quests**
   - Mark all previous daily quests as archived.
   - Generate a new set for the current day.

2. **Core anchors (always included)**
   - Always include these three `daily_core` quests:
     - `LOAD_QUEST_LOG`
     - `CHOOSE_MAIN_QUEST`
     - `HEALTHBAR_CHECKIN`

3. **Focus slot (push something forward)**
   - Pick **1 quest** from the Focus / Work pool (`FIRST_STRIKE_FOCUS`, `BOSS_BATTLE_SESSION`, `DOUBLE_COMBO`, `TAG_IN_THE_CHORES`).
   - Avoid repeating the same quest more than two days in a row.

4. **Protection slot (protect the human)**
   - Pick **1 quest** from the Recovery / Protection pool (`RECHARGE_RUN`, `INTENTIONAL_CHILL`, `ZONE_RESET`, `HYDRATE_BEFORE_BATTLE`, `POTION_TRIO`, `NO_DRY_AFTERNOON`).
   - Balance hydration vs recovery so the board isn’t all water quests.

5. **Light day swaps (optional)**
   - On lighter days, swap either the focus or protection slot with **1** quest from the Light “Feel Good” pool.

6. **Habit quests (optional extras)**
   - If you still want user-selected habits, pull from the `daily_habit` pools below (hydration/focus/hp_core/chores_work). These can be added as extra quests beyond the five core slots or used as bonus quests. Avoid the retired single-tap chores.

7. **Bonus quest**
   - Optionally add **1 `bonus` quest** (can reuse a `daily_habit` or `daily_core` definition but flagged as bonus) based on what was low yesterday:
     - If focus minutes were low → prefer a focus quest.
     - If hydration was low → prefer a hydration quest.
     - If HP was low → prefer an HP quest.

8. **Quest chest requirement**
   - Default: flag **4 quests** as `counts_for_daily_chest = true`:
     - `LOAD_QUEST_LOG`
     - `CHOOSE_MAIN_QUEST`
     - `HEALTHBAR_CHECKIN`
     - The focus slot quest (or the swapped-in light quest if it replaced focus).
   - Optionally flag the protection slot instead if it better balances the day.
   - When all `counts_for_daily_chest` quests are completed, the user can claim the Quest Chest.
   - **Chest reward:** 75 XP (flat).

9. **Total daily XP target (from quests)**
   - With the above mix, a “normal” day should offer:
     - Anchors ≈ 50 XP
     - Focus slot ≈ 20–60 XP
     - Protection slot ≈ 20–35 XP
     - Optional habits/bonus: 20–120 XP depending on how many are enabled
     - Chest reward: 75 XP
     -> Rough range ≈ **165–315 XP** from quests alone, plus XP from timers if you award that separately.

### Weekly Quest Generation

When a new week starts (or first app open on the start-of-week day):

1. **Reset weekly quests**
   - Archive last week’s weekly quests and snapshot their state.

2. **Generate weekly quests**
   - Always include these four:
     - `WEEK_FOCUS_10_SESSIONS`
     - `WEEK_HYDRATE_4_DAYS_64OZ`
     - `WEEK_HP_5_CHECKINS`
     - `WEEK_DAILY_CORE_4_DAYS`
   - Then pick **2 additional** from:
     - `WEEK_FOCUS_3_DEEP`
     - `WEEK_CHORE_5_TIMERS`
     - `WEEK_SELFCARE_3_DAYS`
     - `WEEK_MOVEMENT_3_DAYS`
   - Total weekly quests visible: **6** at a time.

3. **Weekly progress**
   - Progress updates passively as normal events occur (no special actions needed).
   - Weekly quests never block daily quests; they are always optional extra XP.

### Reroll Rules

- User may **reroll 1 daily quest per day**.
- Only **incomplete** quests can be rerolled.
- Reroll picks a replacement quest that:
  - Matches the **same type** (`daily_core` vs `daily_habit` vs `bonus`).
  - Matches the **same difficulty tier** (Tiny/Small/Medium/Big).
  - Preferably matches the **same category** (hydration/focus/etc.) to avoid punishment.
- If the rerolled quest was `counts_for_daily_chest = true`, the replacement quest also gets `counts_for_daily_chest = true`.
